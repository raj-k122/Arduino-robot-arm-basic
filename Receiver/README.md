# Servo motor control with keyboard


# Introduction
This code will allow the user to control any one of four servo motors with simple keyboard strokes
It includes the following components:
1. Arduino UNO
2. PlatformIO extension in VScode (optional)
3. Jumper wires
4. 4 servo motors (5V)

This code was written in an attempt to understand the basics of forward kinematics in robotics. Which is why the motors in the code are labelled as:
* HIP
* SHOULDER
* ELBOW
* WRIST


# Setup

# Usage
1. After uploading the code open up the serial monitor
2. Follow the instructions in the main.cpp file that dictates which keyboard stroke corresponds to which servo movement
